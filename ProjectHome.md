ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use. ns-3 is free software, licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license, and is publicly available for research, development, and use.

This used to be a backup site for posting releases, in case the main site became unavailable.  However, Google Code has disabled posting new downloads, so this site is now more or less defunct.
